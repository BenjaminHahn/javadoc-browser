* javafx learning project
* browser for offline html javadoc documentation

The application does search for javadoc.jar files in the current directory. You will be able to search for specific pages, using some simple syntax.
Start a search word with '*' will only display exact results.
Start a search word with '?' will only display result beginning with the word.
End a search word with '?' will only display result ending with the word.

Work in progress... :)
